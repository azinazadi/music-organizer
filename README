= Music Orderer

this program re-orders your music files (mp3s) in a nice directory structure according to their artist, album and track number.
I wrote this program, because I copied a lot of MP3s from an IPod but they just had some crazy names in crazy folders, totally random, and I liked to sort them out into the appropriate folders. So using this program you can organize your music files based on the ID3 tags stored in the files, rename and move them to a very nice directory structure, like 
	> sorted/Nina Simone/Jazz And The City [Disc 1]/11 - Sugar In My Bowl

= how to use
